What is Bootstrap?
<br>
Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development
<br>

Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins
<br>

Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs
<br>

<br>

Where to Get Bootstrap?
<br>
There are two ways to start using Bootstrap on your own web site.
<br>

You can:
<br>
Download Bootstrap from getbootstrap.com
<br>

Include Bootstrap from a CDN
<br>

Downloading Bootstrap
<br>

If you want to download and host Bootstrap yourself, go to getbootstrap.com, and follow the instructions there.
<br>


Bootstrap CDN <br>
<br>

If you don't want to download and host Bootstrap yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).
<br>

MaxCDN provides CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript. You must also include jQuery:
<br>

MaxCDN:
<!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<br>

<!-- jQuery library -->
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<br>

<!-- Latest compiled JavaScript -->
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
